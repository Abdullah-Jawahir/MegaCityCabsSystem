# Megacity Cab System

The **Megacity Cab System** is a web application designed to manage a popular cab service in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Built as a pure Java/Maven project, it provides a robust platform for customers to book cabs, manage bookings, and handle payments, while offering administrators tools for driver assignment, billing, and customer support. The application is deployed on Apache Tomcat and uses a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate builds and deploy documentation to GitHub Pages.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for customers and admins.
- **Booking Management**: Create, view, and cancel cab bookings with a user-friendly interface.
- **Billing and Payments**: Generate and print bills, process payments with client-side validation.
- **Driver Assignment**: Assign drivers to bookings with nullable driver IDs for flexibility.
- **Email Notifications**: Confirmation emails with tracking buttons for customers.
- **Customer Support**: Dedicated help pages for both customers and admins.
- **Dynamic UI**: Interactive dashboards, searchable content, and responsive layouts.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for backend logic.
- **Maven**: Build automation and dependency management.
- **Apache Tomcat**: Servlet container for deploying the web application.
- **JSP/HTML/CSS**: Frontend for rendering web pages.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user, booking, and billing data.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying documentation.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting for project documentation.
